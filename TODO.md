 - Chapter 14
    - Challenge 1
        - "Devise an encoding that compresses the line information for a series of instructions on the same line."
        - Deferring this due to required research.
    - Challenge 2
        - "many instruction sets feature multiple instructions that perform the same operation but with operands of different sizes. Leave our existing one-byte `OP_CONSTANT` instruction alone, and define a second `OP_CONSTANT_LONG` instruction. It stores the operand as a 24-bit number, which should be plenty."
        - From reading ahead, I recall vaguely that something like this ends up being implemented.  Deferring.
    - Challenge 3
        - Research memory allocation strategies.  Deferring.
